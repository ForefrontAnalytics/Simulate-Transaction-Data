# Simulate Transaction Data

**Forefront Analytics, Feb 2018**

This notebook was developed to test the new Amazon Web Services SageMaker
service.

See the related blog post at [our website](https://www.forefrontanalytics.com.au/).  

Here we simulate several years of POS transaction data for a hypothetical
retail chain with stores located throughout Australia, to be written to an SQL
database. We would like the data to exhibit realistic seasonal, weekly, hourly
and geographic trends. These simulated transactions can then be used as a
resource for developing ML models or data visualisation dashboards.
